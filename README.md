# Manage-My-Tasks Application
This is a side project that I created using tkinter and database (sqlite3) in Python. This desktop application enables the user to save details of a task that needs to be completed before a deadline. The user can then visit this application as many times as required to update the details or keep a tab on upcoming tasks by viewing them at a glance.
## Installation
This program has been created in Python 3.7.0 and SQLite3
