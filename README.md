# Manage-My-Tasks Application
This is a side project that I created using tkinter and database (sqlite3) in Python. This desktop application enables the user to save details of a task that needs to be completed before a deadline. The user can then visit this application as many times as required to update the details or keep a tab on upcoming tasks by viewing them at a glance.
## Built With
This program has been created in Python 3.7.0 and SQLite3
## Usage
To save a new task in the database, enter relevant details and hit 'CREATE NEW REMINDER'

To view or edit tasks existing in the database, click on 'SHOW MY TASK LIST' or simply hit 'CANCEL' to close the application
In the view window, select a task to edit or delete and hit 'EDIT TASK'

Now enter new details and click 'SAVE' or just hit the 'DELETE' button to remove the task from the database.

## Inspiration
I came up with the idea of creating this project when I realized how hard it is for me to menatally keep a tab on all the tasks that I'm supposed to complete.
